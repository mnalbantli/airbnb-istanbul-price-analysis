We recently opened Masif House as well.I have graduated from Istanbul University with a degree in Business Administration and as a student discovered our beautiful nature when I had joined a climbing club at Istanbul University. Climbing then became a hobby for me. Aside from mountain climbing, I also go canyoning, caving (there are lots of caves waiting to be discovered in Turkey), scuba diving and try to see other parts of the world. I think growing up among tourists has given me the culture of traveling. Not only is Istanbul beautiful, our world is so beautiful and so colorful and we must see every single part of our great world before we die. In short: I cannot live without Istanbul!
