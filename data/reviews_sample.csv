You will find quite a few vibrant murals and nice cafes around.<br/>We got very useful advice about the area and Istanbul in general from İnanç, who is the best host I've ever met! We would definitely book the place again for our next visit and highly recommend it to others:)"

541629,289042011,2018-07-11,42132508,Amer,Positives: the location was good. <br/>The neighborhood is authentic and close to main attractions and metro station. <br/>Négative: there was no air conditioning even though that was listed as one of the features. The house is different  from the pictures and not very clean. <br/>The house had a lot of potential but needs improvement.

It's located near Taksim square, public transport is just around the corner, so getting to anywhere in Istanbul is quite easy.<br/>The hosts are very nice and helpful.<br/>I recommend this place as well as the hosts."

It had great views from the front room, it was clean, very big and had lots of space. It was also in a perfect spot only five minutes walk from the boats into Istanbul. Thanks a lot for everything Toygar!"

Siempre estuvo atento a cada necesidad y muy rápido en responder nuestras preguntas.<br/>Su lugar está convenientemente y céntricamente ubicado. Caminamos hasta la Torre Gálata. Puede encontrar mercados al otro lado de la calle ya poca distancia a pie de restaurantes. Cuenta con las necesidades básicas para su estadía. Han pensado en cada detalle: planchas, sombrillas, etc. Sentimos que la relación precio vs. y el servicio prestado superó las expectativas.<br/>Serdar es el caballero más amable y dulce, nos sentimos afortunados de haberlo conocido, nos sentimos protegidos y cuidados. Llegó a esperar con nosotros para tomar el taxi al aeropuerto. También fue nuestro traductor e incluso negoció con el taxista (lol). Solo tenemos cosas buenas que decir sobre nuestra estancia.<br/>Mucha suerte a Serdar y Valeriya."

Within a couple blocks you can find bars, restaurants and stores. The flat is very big, having four private rooms. Moving around is pretty easy because it has a metro station just around the corner. It’s perfect for doing tourism in the city because of all the transportation facilities it has. I’m definitely recommending and coming back to it."
39775635,709561732,2020-11-17,211611719,Kassem,"We stayed 5 nights, first of all Mr Kemal is very helpful and professional and always on the line with quick response, it's a lovely spacious apartment, well equipped, very clean, comfortable, charming view to Galata tower, we like the design, quiet street, perfect location, next to Galata tower, 2 minutes from the metro station (Şişhane) , 3 minutes from the tramway station (karaköy)  2 minutes from the famous Istiklal street, 5 minutes from the ferry boat station (karaköy),lots of coffee shops, restaurants and touristic shops around the area with historical vibes, the best location ever in Galata area, heart of history, I highly recommend it."

53624611,1179553360884973517,2024-06-15,36560672,Kashif,"Naomi and Ozgur were super hosts.  They always responded to any messages promptly and were always just worried that we were taken care of.  The home is an amazing place which is from 1890 that has been restored.  The location was in the Galata area, so in the middle of everything.  The house is on top of a steep hill, so for elderly or people with heart conditions you will need to plan on taking the Tunnel up as there is no way for you to walk it.  The hosts and the place were just amazing.  I needed a fan and they dropped one of the next day.  Internet is about 50Mbps down and 15Mbps up for people who work remotely.  Overall a great experience and will most definitely recommend this place."
876588992580104512,1132965289667369956,2024-04-12,131828909,Liliana,"These hosts are really nice and responsive, and the room is great! The location is a little inconvenient— a bit far from public transit— so as a woman traveling alone, I’m not sure if I’d book on this neighborhood again but that has nothing to do with the hosts and the room. Both were excellent"

Opening the toilet window during nights helps but needs better maintenance and cleaning for sure."

731758433189915880,1023699251134706832,2023-11-13,92868381,Dan Cristian,"I would recommend some repairs and a full clean-up before renting this place again. The flat is ok and it has good taste, no comment there, but it's 'trashy'. If you are into cracked floors, washing your white socks every 5 minutes, dirt almost everywhere and spider webs, then this is your place. I'm sure it has its vibe and some people are ok with it, but pictures don't reflect the reality. Please repair the broken shower, invest more in the mattress and the quality of the pillows and sheets, fix the lightbulbs, get a better router (with more power and coverage) (couldn't use wi-fi from the bedroom). I get the idea of an open shower in the bedroom (which works mostly for couples), but venting the steam in the entire house is not ok. I had high hopes from the pictures but was a bit disappointed when I got there, and that's because the please looks cool and has great potential, don't let it go to waste. Location is also great, though I wouldn't recommend it for women traveling alone."

Check in was easy and he even gave us some fresh fruit as a welcome and later prepared us a delicious Tirkish breakfast. He also arranged an airport transfer for us early in the morning and was always available to answer questions and help. The location is great, wifi and AC work well. Overall no complaints! I recommend staying here!"

The location is great - very close to Kabatas (tram, ferry), but it's in small street so it was quiet. The process of accomodation was well explained and without any complications. The host responded to any question we had immediately. Good value for the money, would definitely stay there again."

Its abiut 10 minutes walk to the Blue Mosque, Hippodrome etc. There are some good restaurants in easy walking distance. Taking a left turn out of the apartment and going down hill you'll find restaurants and a little supermarket.  There are other restaurants going up hill as well. The tram is close by to get to other parts of Istanbul. All in all a great location. Döne was very helpful and responded quickly to questions etc. She orgsnised taxis for us and although we didn't need help with anything whilst there i got the impression that she would help if asked. We would stay there again!"

In the heart of Kadikoy close to shops, markets, restaurants, cafes, bars and buzzing night life.Everything is on the doorstep including great breakfast places. In the meantime the apartment was overlooking to a green garden and very tranquil with a view. Being on a pedestrianised street made it very quite and peaceful. <br/>Within 5 minutes walking distance we manage to get all the transport, Metro, ferry, bus and taxis. Ferry takes you to European side of the city and makes a very enjoyable trip.<br/>The apartment was very clean and<br/>spacious with well equipped kitchen and nice bathroom. Having a washing machine, a dishwasher and study desk was helpful. Air conditioning was available but as the house was well aired and cool even in the middle of summer we did not need to use the AC.<br/>Our host was very helpful, prompt and easy to communicate and loaded us with lots of local information and entertainment tips. <br/>We would go back and highly recommend."

The communication was fast, clear, very helpful. The apartment is on the third floor in the quiet street next to famous Galata Tower. It is very clean, nicely decorated in every room. The beds are very comfortable. There are necessary kitchen appliances for making breakfast and cooking if needed.  It’s very easy to get to all sightseeings from the apartment, T1 tram stop is 6 min away down the hill. Taxis are always around in this area. Plenty of good restaurants and cafes nearby. Perfect wifi connection. We had a wonderful stay at this apartment! Great job, Rasim!"

Он начал сердиться и возмущаться, потому что это его квартира и соответственно его условия должны быть и он может заходить когда захочет в СВОЮ квартиру. Так как меня не было дома он предложил прийти с гостями когда я приду и показать гостям при мне, но мой ответ был отрицательным. Тк я не собираюсь устраивать показы и не хочу впускать незнакомых людей во время моего проживания (5 дней) и попросила устроить это мероприятие после моего отъезда. В ответ я услышала много негатива, какой я плохой человек и тд И хозяин отправил заявление на ранний выезд, так как не хочет чтобы я проживала в этой квартире. (Я останавливалась с сестрой и мамой) при том правил мы не нарушали. Он хотел также зайти, в квартиру, тк у него есть ключи."

Jeg vil tillade at betegne lejeligheden som penthouse lejlighed, for den havde alt hvad en penthouse lejelighed har, stor dejlig terresse. Omgivelserne er helt perfekt for alle aldersgrupper. Der er en fælles pool som vi alle fik brugt flittigt. Tak til Ceyda og hendes mand som jævnligt fulgte op på vores ophold. Helt perfekt host. Kan varmt anbefale.  👍🏻"

Even after getting in after 9pm Velat (I hope I spelled that right) offered us tea and cookies and sat with us and explained everything. They have a great breakdown of the hotel itself as well as a book of local spots to go too. The amazing place speaks for itself and Yusuf and Velat push it over the edge for an excellent place to stay with their amazing hospitality. The restaurant downstairs was also THE best meal we had while in Istanbul so, it's got that too haha. Walk to everything, cleaned every day, yeah, 5-stars all around. Great spot, would recommend, and will definitely stay again!"

Так же квартира вся прокурена все вещи воняют запахом сигарет. Удивительно что большое количество людей в отзывах этой квартиры пишут что им все понравилось.

Not to mention his quick and fast response, if you need anything from him he will be there in 4 minutes. You can ask him for any information about Istanbul and he will sort you out. The only small issue is the apartment is located on ground floor so you night hear some noise of people passing by but nonetheless everything else was on point."

En caso de querer/necesitar usarlo, está a tan solo unos metros, ¡por lo que genial!.<br/>La zona tiene restaurantes, supermercados, cajeros automáticos, puntos de información turística y diferentes tipos de comercios a tan solo unos pasos. Sin embargo, puedes descansar sin problemas.<br/>El hostal está más que limpio, las instalaciones cuidadas y tiene más de lo necesario para tener una estancia satisfactoria, pero, sin duda alguna lo mejor de todo....es el staff!! Profesionalmente, es un placer saber que ellos siempre están dispuestos a ayudarte a hacer una reserva, recomendarte aquello que más se adapta a tus gustos, mediar entre los locales y tú....¡un placer y muy sencillo todo!.  Poder charlar con ellos y conocer de primera mano rasgos de la cultura, gastronomía, historia ha sido lo que ha marcado la diferencia en mi estancia."

24643897,675068802185368666,2022-07-20,74505252,Kene,Great location. Literally Galata Tower - the key landmark of Istanbul is a 1 minute walk away and can be seen on the terrace of the building. Host was very responsive and will meet you same day of arrival to ensure the home meets your needs. Location well furnished. AC available. Quiet at night in the building. Despite the tourist dining activities at night.

You can find bus stop, small turkish restaurant, ATM, minimarket, and traditional market (on wednesday). And the most important: the heater helped me during winter season. Never switch off by landlord. "

The view is majestic, and the place itself is super welcoming and comfortable, perfect after a long day of sight-seeing!<br/>Istanbul is known to be a very 'dynamic' city, so I was a little concerned about the noise and agitation. Fear not! This place has it all: optimal location (it will take you less than 2 minutes to be on the Galata Tower forecourt) as well as peace and quiet.<br/>Communication with both hosts was great.<br/>I couldn't recommend this place with more enthusiasm."
