# Istanbul Airbnb Price Analysis & Price Estimator App

This project explores Airbnb listing prices in Istanbul using real-world data from Inside Airbnb. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling ‚Äî all presented in a well-documented Jupyter notebook.  

In addition, a **Streamlit-powered app** has been built to let users interactively predict nightly prices based on listing features.
